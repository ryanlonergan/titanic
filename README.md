# Titanic Datatset Exploration
<br><br>
In this project, I explored different prediction models using the popular [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and guaged their performance through the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
<br><br>
While I have used this dataset previously to learn different techniques, like cleaning or clustering, I never saw the project through from the first stages to the final ones and believe a lot of data science students have a similar experience. Therefore, my aim was to do exactly that to gain a better understanding of the process of creating machine learning models. To do so, I have attempted to go into the project as "blind" as possible and wanted my research to be minimal as well. Throughout the process, I will document my thoughts in the code to reflect on my process later on. Overall, the stages I have broken down the project into are:
- Cleaning, EDA and Feature Engineering
- Model Creation
- Hyper-Parameter Tuning and Model-Selection
- Final Model Performance
