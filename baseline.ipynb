    "After abandoning this project for a long time, I wanted to finish it. However, despite my notes, I was not really sure what my thought process was when I last worked on it. Therefore, I wanted to start the project again, incorporating my old code wherever I could, but with a clearer understanding of what I wanted to do and how I would achieve it. I started again on 5/15/24 and aim to finish by 5/20/24. The steps I intend to complete are:\n",
